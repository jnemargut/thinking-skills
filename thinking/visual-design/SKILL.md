description: Re-skin any existing HTML artifact OR SVG asset with a chosen aesthetic. Post-step aesthetic thinking. For HTML: walks through 5 decisions (tradition, color, type, mood, signature flourish) and rewrites the style block. For SVG icons/illustrations: walks through 3 decisions (tradition, stroke weight, color) and rewrites the stroke/fill attributes. Produces a side-by-side styled file + tokens.json sidecar. Use AFTER producing an artifact that looks visually generic — output from another thinking skill (strategize, game-plan, better-proposal, launch-playbook, product-design), an existing HTML page, or a raw SVG icon.

# Visual Design

You are helping the user re-skin an existing artifact with a distinct aesthetic. This is a post-step skill: something else produced the artifact; your job is to make it feel like *something*, not a generic template.

The skill supports two modes based on the input file:
- **HTML mode** (`.html` input) — 5-step flow: **Tradition → Color → Type → Mood → Signature Flourish**. Rewrites the `<style>` block.
- **SVG mode** (`.svg` input) — 3-step flow: **Tradition → Stroke → Color**. Rewrites stroke/fill attributes on paths. For icons, logos, and illustrations.

The user invokes `/visual-design [optional path to .html or .svg]`. Original is preserved; a new `<name>.styled.html` or `<name>.styled.svg` is written alongside, and `.visual-design/tokens.json` captures the decisions for reuse in the project.

**Core principles:**
- Write in plain English. Talk like a designer who cares, not a form-builder.
- Each decision presents exactly 4 options *except* Tradition (top 3 matched + 20+ catalog) and Flourish (top 3 curated + library) — those use name-based picking.
- Always include a recommendation.
- Show, don't just tell — every option renders a preview using the actual tradition's tokens.
- The skill's job ends when the styled file and `tokens.json` are on disk and opened for the user.

---

## PHASE 1 — Invocation

### Step 1a — Parse the argument + detect mode

The user invokes `/visual-design [path]` where `[path]` is optional.

**If a path is provided:**
- Verify the file exists.
- Branch on extension:
  - `.html` → set `MODE = "html"`, `TARGET = path`, proceed to Phase 2.
  - `.svg` → set `MODE = "svg"`, `TARGET = path`, proceed to Phase 2.
  - `.png` / `.jpg` / `.jpeg` / `.webp` → tell the user rasters aren't supported (the skill rewrites vector/style, not pixels). Suggest they convert to SVG or provide an HTML wrapper. Stop.
  - Any other extension → tell the user and fall through to the picker path below.

**If no path is provided:**
- Glob for recent styleable artifacts in priority order:
  1. `.decisions/*.html` (most common — decision-kit outputs)
  2. `*.{html,svg}` in cwd
  3. `**/*.{html,svg}` up to 2 levels deep (excluding `node_modules`, `dist`, `.git`)
- Sort results by modification time (newest first).
- If 0 matches: tell the user no artifacts found, suggest running a thinking skill first or passing a path. Stop.
- If 1 match: use it, but confirm with user first:
  > "Found **[filename]** (modified [time ago]). Re-skin this one? Reply `yes` or pass a different path."
- If 2+ matches: show the top 5 with the newest marked ✓:
  > "Found these artifacts. Which one do you want to re-skin?
  >   1. ✓ strategy-brief.html   (2 min ago)
  >   2. icon-download.svg        (1 hr ago)
  >   3. proposal.html            (yesterday)
  > Reply with a number, a filename, or paste a different path."

Once confirmed, set `MODE` from the extension. Wait for confirmation before proceeding.

### Step 1b — Check for project memory

Once `TARGET` is set, check for `.visual-design/tokens.json` at the project root (walk up from the target file to find the nearest one).

- **If present:** parse it. Note the previous tradition + flourish. On the Phase 3 starting screen, surface this as suggestion #1 in the top 3 with the label "your project aesthetic."
- **If absent:** normal flow — skill will create the `.visual-design/` directory later.

### Step 1c — Create `.decisions/` working directory for this run

Create `.decisions/visual-design/` at the project root. Per-step decision pages for this invocation go here.

**HTML mode output:**
- `01-tradition.html`
- `02-color.html`
- `03-type.html`
- `04-mood.html`
- `05-flourish.html`
- `index.html` (run summary)

**SVG mode output:**
- `01-tradition.html`
- `02-stroke.html`
- `03-color.html`
- `index.html` (run summary)

These let the user revisit their aesthetic decisions later.

---

## PHASE 2 — Artifact Analysis

Analysis branches on `MODE`.

### Phase 2 — HTML mode

Read the target HTML file. Extract:

1. **Structural selectors** — every class and ID used on elements. Note the semantic regions (`header`, `footer`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, etc.).
2. **Current style block** — the contents of `<style>...</style>` if present. Note what tokens it already defines (e.g., `:root { --ink: ... }`).
3. **Artifact type hints:**
   - Word count (rough estimate from stripped body text)
   - Heading structure (h1-h6 count)
   - Presence of tables, lists, code blocks, forms
   - Inline font stacks used
4. **Infer artifact type** — one of:
   - `brief` — word-heavy, 1-3 headings, long prose paragraphs
   - `landing` — short hero text, multiple sections, CTAs
   - `doc` — many headings, tables, code blocks
   - `proposal` — mixed — hero + sections + tables + CTAs
   - `dashboard` — low text, many small cards
   - `slide` / `one-pager` — small body, large display text

Keep this as a data structure you reference throughout the run. Example:

```json
{
  "target": ".decisions/strategy-brief.html",
  "mode": "html",
  "type": "brief",
  "wordCount": 2400,
  "headings": { "h1": 1, "h2": 6, "h3": 3 },
  "hasTables": true,
  "hasCode": false,
  "selectors": [".page", ".option", ".footer", ".research", "h1.title", ".deck", "..."]
}
```

### Phase 2 — SVG mode

Read the target SVG file. Extract:

1. **ViewBox and dimensions** — `viewBox`, `width`, `height` attributes on the root `<svg>` element.
2. **Shape inventory** — count of `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polygon>`, `<polyline>`, `<ellipse>`. Note which primitives dominate.
3. **Current styling:**
   - Existing `stroke` and `fill` attributes on shapes (and inside inline `style="..."`)
   - Existing `stroke-width` values
   - Any embedded `<style>` tag inside the SVG
   - Any `<defs>` (gradients, filters, patterns) that will need to be updated or preserved
4. **Color count** — how many distinct colors are used? (1 = single-color, 2-3 = duotone/limited, 4+ = multi-color illustration)
5. **Infer asset type** — one of:
   - `icon` — small viewBox (≤64), 1-2 colors, outline-style (no fill or single fill)
   - `logo` — small-medium viewBox, branded colors, mixed stroke/fill
   - `illustration` — larger viewBox, 4+ colors, complex shapes
   - `glyph` — path-only, single color, no stroke (text-like)

Example:

```json
{
  "target": "icons/download.svg",
  "mode": "svg",
  "type": "icon",
  "viewBox": "0 0 24 24",
  "shapes": { "path": 3, "circle": 0, "rect": 0 },
  "colorCount": 1,
  "currentStroke": "currentColor",
  "currentFill": "none",
  "currentStrokeWidth": "2"
}
```

**Warn the user** if `type === "illustration"` and they've picked a tradition with single-color rules — multi-color illustrations may lose detail when flattened to a tradition's palette.

---

## PHASE 3 — Tradition Selection (Decision 1)

This is the first and biggest decision. The catalog holds 20-30+ traditions; the starting screen gives the user a fast path (top 3 matches) and a surf path (the whole catalog, flat).

### Step 3a — Score the traditions for this artifact

For each tradition in the library (see AESTHETIC TRADITIONS LIBRARY below), compute a fit score from the artifact type:

| Artifact type | Tradition affinities (highest fit first) |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| `brief` (HTML) | Editorial Print, Warm Minimal, Academic, Newsprint, Japandi, Neo-Classical, Botanical Herbarium, Swiss Modern |
| `landing` (HTML) | Neo-Brutalist, Kinetic Modern, Glassmorphic, Playful Maximalist, Y2K Maximalist, Memphis Revival, Retro Futurism, Swiss Modern |
| `doc` (HTML) | Technical Documentary, Swiss Modern, Monochrome, Academic, Dashboard Operator, Newsprint |
| `proposal` (HTML) | Editorial Print, Neo-Classical, Swiss Modern, Warm Minimal, Luxury Serif, Midnight Marine, Art Deco |
| `dashboard` (HTML) | Swiss Modern, Technical Documentary, Dashboard Operator, Kinetic Modern, Monochrome, Neon Terminal |
| `slide` (HTML) | Editorial Print, Neo-Brutalist, Luxury Serif, Kinetic Modern, Art Deco, Bauhaus Grid, Zine |
| `icon` (SVG) | Swiss Modern, Monochrome, Neo-Brutalist, Technical Documentary, Neon Terminal, Cyberpunk Neon, Dashboard Operator, Bauhaus Grid |
| `logo` (SVG) | Swiss Modern, Neo-Brutalist, Art Deco, Luxury Serif, Bauhaus Grid, Retro Futurism, Monochrome |
| `illustration` (SVG) | Warm Handmade, Sketchbook, Botanical Herbarium, Editorial Print, Memphis Revival, Kraft Paper, Playful Maximalist |
| `glyph` (SVG) | Monochrome, Swiss Modern, Neo-Brutalist, Art Deco, Luxury Serif, Academic |

**SVG-incompatible traditions** (warn user if they pick one for an SVG):
- **Glassmorphic** — requires backdrop-filter + layered translucency, meaningless on single-shape icons
- **Playful Maximalist** — gradients-as-default need careful per-shape handling, best for illustrations only
- **Anti-Design** — clashing-font premise doesn't apply to vectors without text

If the user picks one of these in SVG mode, offer a gentle "are you sure? here's what will change" note rather than blocking. The tradition will still resolve (color palette at least).

Top 3 scores become the featured matches. If project memory exists, slot the previous tradition as suggestion #1 regardless of score (with the "your project aesthetic" label).

### Step 3b — Render the tradition decision page

Write `.decisions/visual-design/01-tradition.html` following the HTML TEMPLATE REFERENCE below. The page has two sections:

1. **Matched for your artifact** (3 large tiles, rendered with each tradition's real tokens — type-forward thumbnail style, see below)
2. **Browse all** (flat grid of remaining traditions, ~48px tiles)

Each tile renders the tradition's name using the tradition's **own headline font**, **primary text color**, and **base background**. This is the "type-forward thumbnail" pattern — one word in the tradition's voice. Readable at small sizes, conveys feel instantly.

Open the file with `open .decisions/visual-design/01-tradition.html` and wait for the user's response.

### Step 3c — Handle the user's pick

User's response shapes:
- Name: `Editorial`, `Editorial Print`, `warm minimal`, `Swiss`, `neo-brutal` → fuzzy-match the library (case-insensitive, partial prefix match).
- Shortcut: `top pick` / `first` / `best match` / `A` / `B` / `C` → resolves to the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd matched tile.
- `recommended` → resolves to the highest-scored tradition (usually match #1).
- `more` / `more options` → expand the Browse All grid (if you showed a partial subset initially).
- `surprise me` / `skill's pick` → pick the highest-scored tradition, move on.

If input is ambiguous (multiple traditions match), list the candidates numbered:
> "Could be: 1) Editorial Print, 2) Academic (editorial typeface), 3) Neo-Classical. Reply with a number or a more specific name."

Once locked: set `TRADITION` in state, proceed to Step 3d.

### Step 3d — Calibrate with current references (optional but recommended)

Traditions are a stable grammar. The web has current examples. Combining the two gives you a library that never ages.

After `TRADITION` locks (and before presenting the Color/Type steps), fire 1-2 `WebSearch` queries targeting current real-world examples of this tradition. Good patterns:

- `"<tradition name> web design 2026 examples"`
- `"<tradition name> <artifact type> current trends"` (e.g., "editorial landing page current trends", "neo-brutalist SaaS site 2026")
- For SVG mode: `"<tradition> icon set current"` or `"<tradition> icons 2026"`

From the results, extract 1-3 concrete calibration signals:

- **Shifted accent hue** — is the current wave of this tradition trending warmer/cooler/more saturated? Capture 1-2 specific hex values from the examples.
- **Updated font weight or pairing** — did current examples swap the library's default for something fresher (e.g., Fraunces variable axis set to 144 instead of 96, or paired with Inter Tight instead of Inter)?
- **Trending treatment** — a new signature move the tradition is doing right now (e.g., current Editorial Print examples using big italic pull quotes; current Neo-Brutalist adding subtle grain behind offset shadows).

Store these as `CALIBRATION` in state alongside `TRADITION`. They'll show up in downstream decisions as a "2026 current" variant.

**Skip this step if:**
- Web is unavailable (offline, tool error)
- User said `use library defaults` or `skip calibration` at any prior step
- The tradition is intentionally era-specific and shouldn't track trends (Art Deco, Academic, Neon Terminal — these are stable by definition)

Don't let this step add more than ~5 seconds of latency. One search, extract, move on. If the search returns nothing useful, skip silently — the library defaults are still fine.

---

## PHASE 4 — Remaining Steps

The flow branches on `MODE`:
- **HTML mode** → 4 remaining steps (Color, Type, Mood, Signature Flourish), all A/B/C/D
- **SVG mode** → 2 remaining steps (Stroke, Color), all A/B/C/D

---

## PHASE 4 (HTML mode) — Steps 2-5

All four of these steps use the **A/B/C/D pattern** (standard thinking-skill convention). Each step:
1. Generates a decision HTML page with 4 options
2. Opens it in the browser
3. Waits for a letter-based response

### Step 2 — Color

Given `TRADITION` (and optionally `CALIBRATION` from Step 3d), offer 4 color variants:

- **Option A: Faithful** — the tradition's default ramp + accent as specified by the library.
- **Option B: 2026 current** (when `CALIBRATION` has color signal) — the tradition's ramp with the calibration's shifted accent hue applied. Label this option explicitly: "Pulled from current [tradition] examples on the web." *Fall back to "Warmer" (shift accents toward wood/brick/amber) if no calibration was gathered.*
- **Option C: Cooler** — shift accents toward cooler hues (navy, forest, slate). Always available.
- **Option D: Higher contrast** — pump the contrast between text and background one step. Always available.

Render each option as a mini-frame with the tradition's structure (browser chrome, header, hero headline, CTA button) using the shifted palette. Write `.decisions/visual-design/02-color.html`. Open. Wait.

### Step 3 — Type

Given `TRADITION` + `COLOR` (and optionally `CALIBRATION`), offer 4 type treatments:

- **Option A: Tradition default** — the headline + body pair specified by the tradition (recommended when no calibration).
- **Option B: 2026 current** (when `CALIBRATION` has type signal) — updated font weight / pairing pulled from current examples of this tradition. Label: "Pulled from current [tradition] examples on the web." *Fall back to "Bigger headlines" (same fonts, one scale step up on h1/h2) if no calibration.*
- **Option C: Alternate pair** — the tradition's alternate typeface suggestion (e.g., for Editorial, swap Fraunces display for Source Serif display).
- **Option D: Mono everything** — replace body with a monospace stack (good for technical feel).

Each preview shows a styled headline + two lines of body text at realistic sizes. Write, open, wait.

### Step 4 — Mood

Given prior choices, offer 4 mood combos (shape × shadow bundled):

- **Option A: Sharp + flat** — tight radius, no shadows
- **Option B: Sharp + elevated** — tight radius, strong shadows
- **Option C: Soft + flat** — generous radius, no shadows
- **Option D: Soft + elevated** — generous radius, soft shadows

Each preview shows a CTA button + a card + a divider to demonstrate the combo. The values come from the tradition's tokens; this step picks which combination dominates the artifact.

### Step 5 — Signature Flourish

Given prior choices, load the flourish candidates from the tradition's entry in the SIGNATURE FLOURISH LIBRARY.

- **Top 3 curated** — the 3 flourishes that fit this tradition best (per the table in the flourish library). Surface with the label "✦ fits [tradition] best."
- **Full library below** — all 8-10 flourishes available. Browse flat.

This is the novel step — the anti-generic move. Use name-based picking like Tradition:
- Name: `Drop Cap`, `Pull Quote`, `Grain`, etc.
- `A` / `B` / `C` hits the top 3 tiles
- `none` / `skip` is a valid choice (no flourish)

Each flourish preview renders the flourish rendered inside a small paragraph using the chosen tradition.

Write `.decisions/visual-design/05-flourish.html`. Open. Wait.

---

## PHASE 4 (SVG mode) — Steps 2-3

Two remaining steps after Tradition. Both use A/B/C/D.

### Step 2 — Stroke Weight

Pull the tradition's default stroke weight preference and offer 4 options calibrated around it. For a tradition whose rule specifies "1.5px stroke" (Swiss), the range might be 1 / 1.5 / 2 / 3. For Neo-Brutalist, 2 / 3 / 4 / 6.

General pattern:

- **Option A: Thin** — hairline, precise. Good for dense icon sets and reading-context icons.
- **Option B: Regular** — the tradition's default stroke width (recommended).
- **Option C: Bold** — stepped up one level, more presence.
- **Option D: Very Bold** — aggressive, chunky. Sets the icon apart. Default for Neo-Brutalist, Y2K, Anti-Design.

Render each option as a small grid of 3-4 icon primitives (chevron, plus, check, circle) drawn in the tradition's colors at that stroke width. User sees how each weight reads at typical icon size.

Also apply the tradition's stroke-linecap and stroke-linejoin preference:
- Most traditions → `round` for linecap + linejoin
- Swiss Modern, Bauhaus, Monochrome, Technical, Dashboard → `square` / `miter`
- Neo-Brutalist → `square` + thick miter join
- Neon Terminal, Cyberpunk → `square` with glow filter

Write `.decisions/visual-design/02-stroke.html`. Open. Wait.

### Step 3 — Color

Given `TRADITION` + `STROKE`, offer 4 color treatments:

- **Option A: Faithful palette** — apply the tradition's accent color as stroke/fill (e.g., Editorial's `#9a3412` brick, Cyberpunk's `#ff006e` neon).
- **Option B: Monochrome** — single color, typically the tradition's ink (e.g., Editorial's `#1f1611`, Swiss's `#0f172a`). Most versatile for icon sets — inherits from surrounding text color if set to `currentColor`.
- **Option C: Single accent** — stroke in the tradition's brightest accent, with no fill. Best for call-to-action icons.
- **Option D: Duotone** — two colors on different paths/shapes. Stroke in accent, fill in a secondary tone. Requires 2+ shapes in the SVG to make sense — if the SVG has only 1 path, grey out this option.

Each preview renders the same test icon with each color treatment applied so the user can see the difference directly.

**Special case — SVG uses `currentColor`:** If the input SVG already uses `currentColor` for stroke (common in icon libraries like Lucide, Heroicons), Option B should preserve that. Include a 5th-line note: "Detected `currentColor` — Option B keeps it inheritable."

Write `.decisions/visual-design/03-color.html`. Open. Wait.

---

## PHASE 5 — Rewrite & Output

Branches on `MODE`.

**HTML mode** — Steps 5a–5e below (existing flow).
**SVG mode** — Steps 5s-a through 5s-d (new, after the HTML section).

---

### Phase 5 (HTML mode)

Once all 5 decisions are locked, you have:

- `TRADITION` — tokens + aesthetic rules
- `COLOR` — palette shift applied to ramp
- `TYPE` — headline + body pair + scale
- `MOOD` — shape + shadow combo
- `FLOURISH` — the signature element to add

### Step 5a — Resolve final tokens

Combine everything into a single tokens object:

```json
{
  "tradition": "Editorial Print",
  "variant": {
    "color": "faithful",
    "type": "tradition-default",
    "mood": "sharp-flat",
    "flourish": "drop-cap"
  },
  "tokens": {
    "color": {
      "ramp": ["#fdf6e3", "#f5ecd0", "#e7d7b8", "...", "#1f1611"],
      "accent": "#9a3412",
      "ink": "#1f1611",
      "bg": "#fdf6e3"
    },
    "type": {
      "headline": { "family": "'Iowan Old Style', Georgia, serif", "weights": [400, 600, 700] },
      "body": { "family": "'Source Serif 4', Georgia, serif", "weights": [400, 600] },
      "mono": { "family": "'JetBrains Mono', ui-monospace, monospace" },
      "scale": [12, 14, 18, 22, 32, 52]
    },
    "spacing": [4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 72, 104],
    "radius": [2, 4, 6, 10],
    "shadow": { "l1": "...", "l2": "...", "l3": "...", "l4": "..." },
    "motion": { "ease": "cubic-bezier(.2,.8,.2,1)", "duration": [140, 240, 400] }
  },
  "rules": [
    "Always use Iowan Old Style display at larger sizes.",
    "Italics are expressive tools for kickers and captions.",
    "No gradients — solid warm paper + ink.",
    "..."
  ],
  "flourish": {
    "type": "drop-cap",
    "css": ".drop { float: left; font-family: var(--headline); font-size: 3.5em; line-height: 0.85; padding: 0.1em 0.1em 0 0; color: var(--accent); }",
    "htmlHook": "add <span class=\"drop\">[first letter]</span> to the first paragraph after each h1"
  }
}
```

### Step 5b — Generate the new `<style>` block

Using the artifact's selectors (from Phase 2) and the resolved tokens, compose a complete CSS stylesheet:

1. Add Google Fonts `<link>` if needed (check the tradition's type stack)
2. Add `:root { --... }` with the resolved tokens
3. For each selector in the artifact, write rules that:
   - Apply tradition's aesthetic rules (e.g., offset-solid shadows for Neo-Brutalist, italic kickers for Editorial)
   - Use the resolved tokens for color, spacing, radius, type
   - Preserve layout structure (grid/flex patterns, widths, etc.) — only aesthetic properties change
4. Append the flourish CSS
5. Responsive breakpoints mirror the original (preserve the artifact's mobile behavior)

### Step 5c — Write output files

1. Copy the original artifact HTML structure (body, semantics) into a new file named `<original-name-without-ext>.styled.html` in the same directory as the original.
2. Replace its `<style>...</style>` block with the freshly generated CSS.
3. If `FLOURISH.htmlHook` specifies DOM insertions (e.g., drop caps, pull quotes), apply them minimally — just enough to manifest the flourish.
4. Ensure the `<head>` has the needed Google Fonts `<link>` tags.

### Step 5d — Write tokens sidecar

Write the resolved tokens object (from Step 5a) to `.visual-design/tokens.json` at the project root. Also write `.visual-design/run.json` with the invocation metadata (timestamp, target file, all 5 decisions).

If `.gitignore` exists and doesn't include `.visual-design/`, append a line:
```
# visual-design skill state
.visual-design/
```

### Step 5e — Open + report

Open both files side by side (so user can compare):
```bash
open <original>
open <original-basename>.styled.html
```

Report:
> "Re-skinned! **[basename].styled.html** is open alongside the original.
>
> Applied **[Tradition]** with **[Flourish]**. Decisions saved to `.visual-design/tokens.json` — next run in this project will surface this aesthetic as suggestion #1.
>
> Reply:
> - `love it` → nothing to do, done
> - `redo` → rerun the flow from scratch
> - `change [tradition|color|type|mood|flourish]` → rerun just that step
> - `different flourish` → return to step 5
> - `more contrast` / `warmer` / etc → I'll interpret and adjust"

---

### Phase 5 (SVG mode)

Once all 3 decisions are locked, you have:

- `TRADITION` — aesthetic rules (stroke-linecap, linejoin, filter needs)
- `STROKE` — stroke-width value
- `COLOR` — resolved stroke + fill values (faithful / mono / accent / duotone)

### Step 5s-a — Resolve SVG attributes

Derive the exact attribute values to apply to each shape:

```json
{
  "mode": "svg",
  "tradition": "Editorial Print",
  "variant": { "stroke": "regular", "color": "monochrome" },
  "svg": {
    "strokeWidth": "1.5",
    "stroke": "#1f1611",
    "fill": "none",
    "strokeLinecap": "round",
    "strokeLinejoin": "round",
    "filter": null
  },
  "rootAttributes": {
    "width": "24",
    "height": "24",
    "viewBox": "0 0 24 24",
    "fill": "none",
    "stroke": "currentColor",
    "stroke-width": "1.5",
    "stroke-linecap": "round",
    "stroke-linejoin": "round"
  }
}
```

For traditions with a signature filter (Cyberpunk Neon, Neon Terminal), generate an SVG `<filter>` element to embed under `<defs>`. Example for Neon Terminal's phosphor glow:

```xml
<defs>
  <filter id="vd-glow" x="-50%" y="-50%" width="200%" height="200%">
    <feGaussianBlur stdDeviation="1.5" result="blur"/>
    <feMerge>
      <feMergeNode in="blur"/>
      <feMergeNode in="SourceGraphic"/>
    </feMerge>
  </filter>
</defs>
```

Then apply `filter="url(#vd-glow)"` to grouped shapes.

### Step 5s-b — Rewrite the SVG

The strategy: **hoist common attributes to the root `<svg>` element**, then **remove redundant per-shape attributes**. This keeps the output clean and makes the SVG easy to re-theme later.

1. **Set root attributes** on `<svg>` itself:
   - `stroke`, `fill`, `stroke-width`, `stroke-linecap`, `stroke-linejoin`
   - Keep existing `viewBox`, `width`, `height`
   - Preserve `xmlns`

2. **Strip old styling** from every shape (`<path>`, `<circle>`, etc.):
   - Remove `style="..."` attributes
   - Remove per-shape `stroke`, `fill`, `stroke-width` UNLESS the color treatment is `duotone` and this shape is the "accent" layer — then keep its override.

3. **Duotone handling**:
   - For multi-shape SVGs with duotone: the first half of shapes (or all "filled" shapes) get `fill="var(--accent)"` + `stroke="none"`; the second half get `stroke="var(--ink)"` + `fill="none"`. Tune per SVG inspection.
   - Single-path SVGs can't express duotone — fall back to accent.

4. **Filter injection** (if tradition requires one):
   - Add `<defs>` with the filter after `<svg>` opening
   - Add `filter="url(#vd-glow)"` to either the root `<g>` wrapper OR individual shapes

5. **Add a CSS comment header** inside `<svg>` as a text annotation for discoverability:
   ```xml
   <!-- /visual-design · Editorial Print · 1.5px · monochrome -->
   ```

6. **Preserve everything else** untouched — `<title>`, `<desc>`, `<metadata>`, comments, id attributes, aria attributes.

### Step 5s-c — Write output files

1. Write the rewritten SVG to `<original-basename>.styled.svg` in the same directory as the original.
2. Write tokens to `.visual-design/tokens.json` at the project root (shared with HTML mode — same file, tokens now may include an `svg` field alongside the usual ones).
3. Write run metadata to `.visual-design/run.json` (target, mode, decisions, timestamp).
4. Add `.visual-design/` to `.gitignore` if missing.

### Step 5s-d — Open + report

Open both files side by side (browsers render SVGs directly):
```bash
open <original>
open <original-basename>.styled.svg
```

Report:
> "Re-skinned! **[basename].styled.svg** is open alongside the original.
>
> Applied **[Tradition]** at **[Stroke]px** in **[Color treatment]**. Decisions saved to `.visual-design/tokens.json`.
>
> Reply:
> - `love it` → done
> - `redo` → rerun the flow
> - `change [tradition|stroke|color]` → rerun just that step
> - `more stroke weight` / `different color` → I'll interpret and adjust
> - `apply to other SVGs in this folder` → batch-apply the same aesthetic to sibling .svg files"

**Batch mode (bonus):** if the user invokes `/visual-design` again in the same project and another `.svg` is detected, default to applying the project's saved tokens directly (skip the flow) unless they say otherwise. This makes consistent icon sets trivial.

## RESPONSE PARSING — How Users Pick

The five steps don't all have 4 options, so input parsing varies per step:

### Steps 2, 3, 4 (Color, Type, Mood) — standard A/B/C/D
- Exactly 4 options each. Respond like any thinking skill.
- Accept: `Option A`, `A`, `the first one`, `Option B because [reason]`, `Option A but [modification]`, `more options`.

### Steps 1 and 5 (Tradition, Flourish) — name-based picking
- 10-30+ options, letters don't scale. Pick by name.
- **Primary:** `Editorial`, `Warm Minimal`, `Neo-Brutalist`, `Drop Cap`, `Rule Line`, etc.
- **Fuzzy:** case-insensitive, partial prefix match (`brutal` → Neo-Brutalist, `warm` → Warm Minimal).
- **Top-3 shortcuts:** `A` / `B` / `C` hit the top 3 tiles. Also: `top pick`, `first`, `best match`.
- **Disambiguate:** if input matches >1 tradition, echo candidates numbered, ask for a pick.
- **Recommended:** the highest-scored tradition earns a ★. User can say `recommended` to pick it.

### Catalog-wide commands (any step)
- `more` / `more options` — expand visible set.
- `surprise me` / `skill's pick` — take the highest-scored option, move on.
- `back` / `previous` — step back without rerunning.
- `skip` — at step 5, valid meaning "no flourish." At other steps, use recommended.

Match input against (a) letter regex `^([A-Za-z])\b` at steps 2-4, (b) shortcut keywords, (c) fuzzy name match at steps 1 and 5. Show numbered candidates when ambiguous.

## HTML DECISION PAGE TEMPLATE

Each step generates a decision HTML file. Use a consistent shell with per-step variations.

### Step 1 (Tradition) — structure

- Section A: "Matched for your artifact" — 3 large tiles (160px × 100px each), horizontal row. Each renders the tradition name in the tradition's own type + color + bg.
- Section B: "Browse all" — flat grid, 5 columns × N rows of small tiles (56-64px). Each tile = name in the tradition's type-forward thumbnail style.
- Footer: "Reply with a tradition name (e.g., `Editorial`) or `A`/`B`/`C` for one of the top 3 matches."

### Step 2/3/4 (Color/Type/Mood) — structure

- 4 option cards, 2×2 grid. Each card has:
  - Letter badge (A/B/C/D)
  - Short title ("Faithful", "Warmer", "Higher contrast", etc.)
  - Visual preview rendered with the variant's tokens
  - 1-line description
- Recommended badge on one card (usually A or the tradition-default).
- Footer: "Reply with `Option A`, `A`, or `Option A but [modification]`."

### Step 5 (Flourish) — structure

- Section A: "✦ Fits [Tradition] best" — 3 curated flourish tiles. Each tile renders the flourish *applied to the tradition*, with the flourish name labeled.
- Section B: "Full library" — all ~10 flourishes as smaller tiles, flat grid.
- Include a "None" tile at the end of both sections for users who want no flourish.
- Footer: "Reply with a flourish name (e.g., `Drop Cap`) or `none`."

### Run summary page (`index.html`)

Mirror the decision-hub style used elsewhere in the decision-kit (serif display, mono kickers, warm paper bg). Shows:
- The 5 locked choices
- The final resolved aesthetic summary
- Links to each decision page
- Links to the original + styled artifact

---

## EDGE CASES

**Target file has no `<style>` block:** Inject one inside `<head>` with the full resolved stylesheet. All selectors still match.

**Target file uses external CSS (`<link rel="stylesheet">`):** Convert to inline — fetch the external CSS, rewrite selectors, inline into the `.styled.html`. If external CSS is unreachable (remote, 404), tell the user and skip the file.

**Target file is HTML with embedded `<script>`:** Preserve all scripts. The skill only touches styles and minimal DOM for flourish hooks.

**Target file is already a `.styled.html` / `.styled.svg`:** Ask if the user wants to re-skin it (changing aesthetic) or start over (forgetting the prior aesthetic). If re-skin: use the existing styled file as the source, write a new `<name>.styled.*` overwriting prior styled version, update tokens.json.

**Target file is a PNG/JPG raster:** The skill can't re-style pixels. Tell the user: "I can't restyle raster images — this skill rewrites vector/style. If this is an icon, see if you have the source SVG. If it's a photo, it's out of scope."

**SVG is a multi-color illustration (4+ colors):** Warn the user before Phase 4 starts: "This looks like a multi-color illustration. If you pick a tradition with a single-color rule (most), colors will flatten. Traditions built for illustrations: Warm Handmade, Sketchbook, Botanical Herbarium, Editorial Print. Continue anyway?"

**SVG has `<defs>` with gradients/patterns:** Preserve them. The rewrite only touches stroke/fill on rendered shapes, not referenced `url(#foo)` paint servers — unless the chosen tradition explicitly replaces them (e.g., Y2K Maximalist overriding gradients with its own chrome gradient).

**SVG uses `currentColor`:** Honor it. Monochrome color treatment (Option B in SVG Step 3) should preserve `currentColor` so the icon inherits from its context. Note this on the decision page.

**SVG has only one path:** Grey out the Duotone color option (D) since it needs 2+ shapes.

**Tradition not found (typo):** Show 3 closest matches numbered, ask which.

**User says `redo` after the output:** Delete the `.styled.*` file, re-run from Phase 1 with the same target.

**User says `change [step]`:** Jump to that step's decision page, re-run from there. Downstream choices stay unless they conflict.

**No artifact type detected confidently:** Use `brief` (HTML) or `icon` (SVG) as the fallback for type inference.

---

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS

1. **Never skip a decision step.** The user invoked `/visual-design` because they want to *think through* the aesthetic. Fast ≠ skipped. Each step gets its own HTML page with options.
2. **Always open the file after writing.** `open .decisions/visual-design/0N-<step>.html`. User needs to see what you've generated.
3. **Wait for the user at every step.** Don't proceed until they've picked.
4. **Preserve the original.** Never overwrite the target. Always write `.styled.html` alongside.
5. **Plain English.** Option descriptions talk about feel and audience, not tokens. Save the JSON for the tokens file.
6. **Tokens.json is sacred.** It's what makes the skill compound across artifacts. Write it every run. Respect existing ones as suggestion #1.
7. **Flourish is the hero step.** Step 5 is what separates generic from characterful. Don't treat it as a throwaway.
8. **Fuzzy match is friendly.** Accept typos, partial names, abbreviations (`brutal` → Neo-Brutalist). If truly ambiguous, show numbered candidates.
9. **Respect existing aesthetic.** If the target artifact already uses a well-known tradition (detect by font family hints), suggest that tradition as match #1.
10. **Add to `.gitignore`.** First time `.visual-design/` is created in a project, append a line to `.gitignore` (create if missing).
